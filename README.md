#  k-means clustering algorithm from scratch

Implemented the k-means algorithm from scratch and use it to reduce the color information in a colored image.

## Procedure: 
If K=2 then I divided the colors in an image into two clusters. Once the final means have been calculated, replace each color with its representative mean value.

Documented the results for K=2,3,5,10,15,20.

Moreover applied elbow method for the K values from 1 to 25 to check which K-value is the optimal one and also draw line plot for cost of each k-value.
